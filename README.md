Roads
=====

Problem: </br>
There are N cities. 
Two cities can joined by one bidirectional road.
Input file consists of three parts. In the first, must be three numbers: N (>=1), M and K,
where N - summary cities number, M - number of non-repeated roads,
K - number of roads, that chould be destroyed (K <= M). </br>
In the second path, contains M roads. Third part contains roads for destroy.
After destroying every road in the third path, we should calculate minimal number of roads, 
that can be constructed to any city can be reached from each other.
